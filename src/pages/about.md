## Hello friend,

I'm Yoni,  
24 years old, based out of TLV and waiting for the world to reopen to visit all the beautiful places everywhere.

I like to work on problems that are either important or interesting and ideally, both.

Important problems are about helping people.  

Interesting problems are about experiencing a moment of __aha__ when you solve them.  

At my day job, I'm building an advanced EEG system (reading electrical brainwaves) to (hopefully) help us better understand human consciousness.

When I'm not doing that, there is a whole bunch of things that keep me occupied. If you think I might be interested in something then I probably am and you should [tell me about it](/contact).

And just so you'll have an idea here is a picture of me:
<div style="width:400px;align:center;">
<img src="../images/me.jpg" width="100" style="width:400px;"/>
</div>
