## Hi there,

I'm Yoni,  
22 years old, based out of TLV but traveling often.

I like to work on problems that are either:
1. Important
2. Interesting

Important problems are about helping people.  
I try and solve them by creating techonology (mostly software) to empower individuals.

Intereting problems are about experiencing a moment of __aha__ when you solve them.  

This blog is a collection of my thoughts on various topics.  
One noteworthy section of it is the [weekly reads](/weekly) where I share interesting things I'm reading/recently read and some commentary.

If you think we should work together/collaborate just [contact me](/contact).
