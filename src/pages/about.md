## Hi there

I'm Yoni,<br/>
22 years old, based out of TLV but traveling often.<br/>
And if you're reading this page it's because you want to know more about me.<br/>
So let's start with a photo:
<div style="width:400px;alignS:center;">
<img src="../images/me.jpg" width="100" style="width:400px;"/>
</div>
<br/>

Now let me tell you a bit about me. 

- I have a strong belief that techonology can make the world a better by empowering individuals.
- I'm lucky man. Mostly becasue I spend most of my time doing just that by creating software. 
- I find it really easy to get interested in new things, so if you think there is something I should read about email me at [svechinskyy@gmail.com](mailto:svechinskyy@gmail.com)  

Also email me if you think we should work/collaborate together, or if you have any suggestion for improvement of anything you see here.
