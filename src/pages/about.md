## Hi there,

I'm Yoni,  
22 years old, based out of TLV but traveling often.
<div style="width:400px;align:center;">

</div>

I like to work on problems that are either:
1. Important
2. Interesting

Important problems are about helping people.  
I try and solve them by creating technology (mostly software) to empower individuals.

Interesting problems are about experiencing a moment of __aha__ when you solve them.  

If you think we should work together/collaborate just [contact me](/contact).
