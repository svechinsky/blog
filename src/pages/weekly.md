Going to be sharing interesting stuff I read/overheard on a weekly basis + my opinion

<details><summary>Group at Imperial college in London analyzes hurts with MRI based data and autoencoders, can read a bit about it <a href="https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/ai-analysis-predicts-survival-from-heart-movement/">here</a></summary>

> Really personally exciting. Heart disease runs in my family and any prospects of earlier/better discovery are making me feel just a bit safer.
> They have further research ongoing to map more data on top of the functional one:
> - Advanced variant of ECG for electric activity 
> - Some sort of metabolic analysis.
> 
> I wonder if how much of a generalization would it be to apply to other internal organs (liver, lungs etc.)

<details><summary>Team @Deepmind managed to essentially beat humans playing quake 3, heard about it in CogX, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6443/859">published here</a></summary>

> Disclaimer: Haven't deep dived into the actual paper yet.
> Unsurprisingly they used [RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) to represent time based advancement/decision making. Where the output of each generative step is the next decision to make.  
>   
> Where it gets extremely cool bit is how they stacked RNNs with time steps of varying length on top of each other. This creates a sort of fast system/slow system where one can carry intent and the other respond to immediate action and update the higher systems when their time steps sync.
> This is really cool. I wonder if this can be applied elsewhere? Perhaps robotics.

<details><summary> Apparently out of the 1.4B people in china only half are connected to the internet (90% of usage is via mobile).</summary>

> I find this interesting for two reasons:
>
> 1. Only **half** is connected, looks like a huge opportunity/ study case. What  makes the other half different. I imagine age is a big difference but what else? Could this be traced back to specific decisions and plans of the CPC?
> 2. The fact that mobile completely leapfrogged the PC. This probably happened because China was exposed to both types of devices at the same time. Does this mean that mobile devices are more intuitive to someone who didn't deal with any device before. I wonder if we'll see something similar with Africa/ parts of South America and wearables/
